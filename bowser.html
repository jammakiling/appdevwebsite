                Bowser (クッパ, Kuppa, "Koopa"),[6] also known as King Bowser or King Koopa, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Nintendo's Mario franchise. In Japan, his title is Daimaō (大魔王, "Great Demon King").[7] He is the arch-nemesis of the plumber Mario, and the leader of the turtle-like Koopa race. Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance with dragon-like elements, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, and tyrannical personality. His ultimate goals are to kidnap Princess Peach and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom.
