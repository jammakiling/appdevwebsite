                Toad is Princess Peach's loyal attendant, and he has appeared in almost all of the Mario Kart games up to date, with the exception of Mario Kart Arcade GP VR. Similar to Toadette, Toad is a lightweight driver in every game and therefore quick off the mark. His karts usually have an extra kick to their drift, allowing him to swerve past sharp turns with ease.

Toad is the brother of Toadette (confirmed in the Mario Kart Wii guidebook only), and he is a good friend of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, and Yoshi. Like the other heroes, Toad views Bowser as an enemy.
